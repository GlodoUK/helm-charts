Thank you for installing {{ .Chart.Name }}.

Your release is named {{ .Release.Name }}.

{{- if and .Values.web.enabled .Values.web.ingress.enabled (eq .Values.web.ingress.type "IngressRoute") }}
It is now our intention to deprecate Traefik support within this chart.
This means that we will be looking to remove any Traefik specific resources,
including, but not limited to:
  - IngressRoute
  - Middleware

You *must* start considering the migration process. It is our intention to
remove Traefik CRD after 6 months.

For more information on the why, please take a look at https://github.com/GlodoUK/helm-charts/issues/48.
